# Project
Robot Simulation For Tumor Identification Using Nanobot Swarms

# Process
* Phase 1 - Research
* Phase 2 - Data point extraction
* Phase 3 - Insertion of biomarkers on the extracted data points for detection of tumor
* Phase 4 - Simulation of tumor on NetLogo
* Phase 5 - Navigation of nanobots & tumor identification.

# Outcome
* Phase 1 - The research phase resulted in the selection of the appropriate softwares namely; NetLogo, Python Programming & ImageJ.
* Phase 2 - ImageJ mask tumor and esophagus made using the Overlay option in the Image menu. Mask coordinates will be saved as a csv file.
* Phase 3 - NetLogo code to read the .csv file of the tumor/biomarkers and detection of those biomarkes by nanobots.
* Phase 4 - Tumor is simulated in NetLogo.
* Phase 5 - Nanobots/agents were simulated and followed 3 key rules namely; alignment, cohesion and separation for detection of tumor.

# Competitive Advantage or Unique Selling Proposition
(Cost Reduction, Process improvement, Attainment of any SDG (Sustainable Development Goal), increase of market share or capturing new market or having superior performance over competitor. In summary, any striking aspect of the project which compels industry to invest in FYP or purchase it. Some detail description is required in terms of how, why when what. You can select one or more from following dropdown and delete rest of them)

## Cost reduction of existing Product
A small number of nanobots can be made once, and reprogrammed multiple times. Hence, after retaining them back from a patient's body, we can use them again which greatly reduces our cost for cancer detection, compared to conventional methods like CT simulator, PET-CT, X-RAY etc. which require huge setups and machines.

## Process Improvement which leads to superior product or cost reduction, efficiency improvement of whole process (e.g. What is issue is current process and what improvement you suggests)
Dynamics of the human body can be taken into account, which will enable us to target cancer cells in areas other than esophagus. While detecting cancer cells, nanobots can be made to destroy them as well. Hence, successfully treat cancer without destroying healthy cells

## Attainment of any SDG (e.g. How it is achieved and why it is necessary for the region)
SDG 3, that implies good health and well-being of people is achieved as this detection method saves healthy cells while detecting cancer cells. We shall be attaining the SDG 9, that is industry, innovation and infrastructure by introducing a fairly new idea that gives rise to industrialization. SDG 12, is about responsible consumption and production which we shall be implementing by using gold particles for fabricating nanobots in lieu of radioisotope, for cancer detection. As cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the Pakistan, achieving these sustainable development goals is of utmost importance.

## Expanding of Market share (e.g. how it expand and what is problem with current market
Trends in the industry show that people rely on conventional methods for diagnosis of tumor e.g.: CT, PET, SPECT etc. Nanotechnology is new in the market around the globe, hence hesitation to opt for a new technology due to market resistance to a new product. Thus, educating people about harmful aspects of conventional methods can greatly increase our market share among cancer patients and healthcare officers. We can do that via seminars, conferences, informative videos etc. The current market may need to import hardware machinery for the construction of nanobots and skilled labor which is unavailable

## Capture new market (e.g. Niche market or unaddressed segment)
The niche market comprises of the hospitals with oncology departments specializing in esophageal/ GIT carcinoma.

## Any Environmental Aspect (e.g. carbon reduction, energy efficient etc.)
As using nanobot swarms for tumor diagnosis doesn’t require any radioisotopes, there is an absence of hospital staff/patient’s exposure to ionizing radiations, hence preventing the damage of healthy cells. They do not harm healthy cells because of their precision and capability of recognizing specific gene mutations (biomarkers). Minimal energy and power consumption. Doesn’t require capacious rooms (is space-saving) to accommodate equipment/machinery as opposed to CT, SPECT, PET, X-RAY. Use of programmable nanobots, with user defined parameters, eliminates time constraints. Positive impact on patient’s comfort and psychology by providing miniaturized diagnostic equipment with no requirements of any protective gear.

## Any Other Aspect
Raman spectroscopy optical imaging makes intracellular imaging possible, hence early diagnosis possible.
